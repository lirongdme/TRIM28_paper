# TRIM28_paper
ATAC-seq contains the fastq files triming, mapping, and deduplication of human endometrial stromal datasets
ChIP-seq analysis includes ChIPseq.sh and ChIPseq_trim_and_filter_SE.pl which contains the fastq files triming, mapping, and deduplication of mouse uterus and human endometrial stromal datasets
RNA-seq analysis includes RNAseq.sh, RNAseq_extractFPKM+4x2.pl, and RNAseq_trim_and_filter_PE.pl which contains the fastq files triming, mapping, deduplication and generating DEGs for mouse uterus and human endometrial stromal datasets. 
scRNAseq_seurat contains the clustering, DEG and pseudotime analyis by monocle. scRNA_seurat, scRNAseq_velocyte.sh, scRNAseq_RNA-Velocity.ipynb, scRNAseq-TutorialEnvironment.yml contains the analysis for RNA velocity.
RNA velocity analysis has been following the 10X pipeline at https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/analysis-guides/trajectory-analysis-using-10x-Genomics-single-cell-gene-expression-data, and Seurat pipeline at https://github.com/basilkhuder/Seurat-to-RNA-Velocity
